The `business-companies` database is a collection of tables on information about Minnesota companies and non-profits, specifically for the yearly top business lists. This data is managed by the Business department.

The main outputs of this data are the following:

* [Top 50 businesses](http://apps.startribune.com/top_100_business/revenueView.php)
* [Top 100 CEOs](http://apps.startribune.com/top_100_exec_comp/topCeoView.php)
* [Top 100 Nonprofits](http://www.startribune.com/nonprofit-100/460547793/)
  * Previously [Top 100 Nonprofits](http://apps.startribune.com/top_100_nonprofits/revenueView.php)
