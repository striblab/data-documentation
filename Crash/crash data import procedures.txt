Code used to convert fixed width files to CSV.

Put the schema files and data files in pythonwork folder on C drive of my regular computer (don't need to be logged in as admin)

Open command window and navigate to that folder

type this in command window for each file you want to convert:

in2csv -f fixed -s acc_schema.txt mn-2014-acc.txt > acc_2014.csv


Components of that line:
in2csv -- command
-f fixed (this tells it that it's a fixed-wdith file)
-s acc_schema.txt (this tells it to use this file as the schema)
mn-2014-acc.txt (this is the name of the file you want to convert; you can point to a different directory....  2013/mn-2013-acc.txt )
>  (symbol to say convert into)
acc_2014.csv  (output file name)
