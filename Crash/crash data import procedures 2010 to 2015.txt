Code used to convert fixed width files to CSV.


look for long dashes



Open command window and navigate to folder that holds data and schema files

type this in command window for each file you want to convert:

in2csv -f fixed -s acc_schema.txt mn-2014-acc.txt > acc_2014.csv


Components of that line:
in2csv -- command
-f fixed (this tells it that it's a fixed-wdith file)
-s acc_schema.txt (this tells it to use this file as the schema)
mn-2014-acc.txt (this is the name of the file you want to convert; you can point to a different directory....  2013/mn-2013-acc.txt )
>  (symbol to say convert into)
acc_2014.csv  (output file name)
