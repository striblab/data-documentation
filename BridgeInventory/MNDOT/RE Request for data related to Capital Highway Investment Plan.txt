Subject: Request for data related to Capital Highway Investment Plan

This is a request under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act. 

I am requesting  the following: 

1)	a copy of the GIS shapefile identifying projects that are on the 2017-2026 Capital Highway 
Investment plan. The shapefile is being used for the interactive map that is on this webpage: 
http://www.dot.state.mn.us/planning/10yearplan/. In addition, please provide any metadata – 
record layouts, data dictionary, etc – that would be necessary to understand the data.

2)	Copy of a similar shapefile, (or the underlying data if a shapefile hasn’t yet been created), that 
goes with the update to the 10-year Capital Highway Investment plan that you are currently 
working on. I realize this may not be ready for a few weeks, and that’s ok. In addition, please 
provide any metadata – record layouts, data dictionary, etc – that would be necessary to 
understand the data.

3)	A copy of the DRAFT version of the Capital Highway Investment Plan that is currently being 
worked on. I understand this likely won’t be ready until June. 


As a member of the media representing the public interest, I ask that any fees for this request be 
waived. However, if there will be any cost associated with fulfilling this request, please provide me an 
estimate in advance so that I can get it approved by my supervisors. 

Just an FYI that I plan to use ArcGIS desktop for working with the shapefiles I have requested. 

Please don’t hesitate to contact me with questions at this email or the office phone number below. 

Thank you.
