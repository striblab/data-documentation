Subject: Bridge inventory data request

This is a request under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act. 

I would like to request the most recent bridge inventory data on all Minnesota bridges. Please include all 
fields of information. (I’m assuming this would be the fields that show up on the “Bridge Inspection and 
Inventory Report” that can be generated for a single bridge from your website, 
http://dotapp7.dot.state.mn.us/bridgereports/Content.aspx)

I would prefer the data be provided in a text-delimited file or any other format that can be imported to 
Excel or a database manager software. When the data is ready, please contact me and I can provide 
access to the Star Tribune’s FTP account for uploading. Please also provide any record layouts, data 
dictionaries or other metadata that would be necessary to understand the data.

As a member of the media representing the public interest, I ask that any fees for this request be 
waived. However, if there will be any cost associated with fulfilling this request, please provide me an 
itemized estimate in advance so that I can get it approved by my supervisors. 

Please don’t hesitate to contact me with questions at this email or the office phone number below. 

Thank you.
