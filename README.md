# StribLab Documentation Library

Drag and drop your files/folders into the repo

This repo contains documentation for databases collected by the Strib newsroom's data team, particularly those that are housed on our data servers on Amazon Web Services (which started in January 2017). This should include things like a "readme" file about each dataset and how we used it (or continue to use it), record layouts, code books, public records request letters, create table statements, import queries and any other documentation required to understand and work with data that we have in-house.
